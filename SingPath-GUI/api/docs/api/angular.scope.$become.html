<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="description"><p>Modifies the scope to act like an instance of the given class by:</p>

<ul>
<li>copying the class's prototype methods</li>
<li>applying the class's initialization function to the scope instance (without using the new
operator)</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes the scope be a <code>this</code> for the given class's methods â€” effectively an instance of
the given class with additional (scope) stuff. A scope can later <code>$become</code> another class.</p>

<p><code>$become</code> gets used to make the current scope act like an instance of a controller class.
This allows for use of a controller class in two ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>as an ordinary JavaScript class for standalone testing, instantiated using the new
operator, with no attached view.</li>
<li>as a controller for an angular model stored in a scope, "instantiated" by
<code>scope.$become(ControllerClass)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Either way, the controller's methods refer to the model  variables like <code>this.name</code>. When
stored in a scope, the model supports data binding. When bound to a view, {{name}} in the
HTML template refers to the same variable.</p></div>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<div class="usage"><div ng:non-bindable=""><pre class="brush: js; html-script: true;">angular.scope.$become();</pre>
</div>
</div>
