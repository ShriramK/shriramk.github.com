<h1>Developer Guide: Angular Services: Registering Angular Services</h1>

<p>To register a service, register a factory function that creates the service with angular's
Injector. The Injector is exposed as <a href="#!/api/angular.scope.$service"><code>scope.$service</code></a>. The
following pseudo-code shows a simple service registration:</p><div ng:non-bindable><pre class="brush: js;">
angular.service('service id', function() {
  var shinyNewServiceInstance;
  //factory function body that constructs shinyNewServiceInstance
  return shinyNewServiceInstance;
});
</pre></div><p>Note that you are not registering a service instance, but rather a factory function that will
create this instance when called.</p>

<h2>Instantiating Angular Services</h2>

<p>A service can be instantiated eagerly or lazily. By default angular instantiates services lazily,
which means that a service will be created only when it is needed for instantiation of a service or
an application component that depends on it. In other words, angular won't instantiate lazy
services unless they are requested directly or indirectly by the application.</p>

<p>Eager services on the other hand, are instantiated right after the injector itself is created,
which happens when the angular <a href="#!/guide/dev_guide.bootstrap">application initializes</a>.</p>

<p>To override the default, you can request that a service is eagerly instantiated as follows:</p><div ng:non-bindable><pre class="brush: js;">
angular.service('service id', function() {
  var shinyNewServiceInstance;
  //factory function body that constructs shinyNewServiceInstance
  return shinyNewServiceInstance;
}, {$eager: true});
</pre></div><p>While it is tempting to declare services as eager, only in few cases it is actually useful. If you
are unsure whether to make a service eager, it likely doesn't need to be. To be more specific, a
service should be declared as eager only if it fits one of these scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nothing in your application declares this service as its dependency, and this service affects the
state or configuration of the application (e.g. a service that configures <code>$route</code> or <code>$resource</code>
services)</li>
<li>A guarantee is needed that the service will be instantiated at application boot time, usually
because the service passively observes the application and it is optional for other application
components to depend on it.  An example of this scenario is a service that monitors and logs
application memory usage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, it is important to realize that all angular services are applicaiton singletons. This means
that there is only one instance of a given service per injector. Since angular is lethally allergic
to the global state, it is possible to create multiple injectors, each with its own instance of a
given service, but that is rarely needed, except in tests where this property is crucially
important.</p>
