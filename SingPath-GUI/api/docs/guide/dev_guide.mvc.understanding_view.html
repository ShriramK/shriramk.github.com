<p>In angular, the view is the DOM loaded and rendered in the browser, after angular has transformed
the DOM based on information in the template, controller and model.</p>

<p>In the angular implementation of MVC, the view has knowledge of both the model and the controller.
The view knows about the model where two-way data-binding occurs. The view has knowledge of the
controller through angular directives, such as <a href="#!/api/angular.directive.ng:controller"><code>ng:controller</code></a> and <a href="#!/api/angular.widget.ng:view"><code>ng:view</code></a>, and through bindings of this form:
<code>{{someControllerFunction()}}</code>. In these ways, the view can call functions in an associated
controller function.</p>
