<h1>Developer Guide: Scopes: Updating Scope Properties</h1>
<div class="developer-guide-scopes-updating-scope-properties"><fieldset class="workInProgress"><legend>Work in Progress</legend>
This page is currently being revised. It might be incomplete or contain inaccuracies.</fieldset>
<p>You can update a scope by calling its <a href="#!/api/angular.scope.$eval"><code>$eval()</code></a> method, but usually
you do not have to do this explicitly. In most cases, angular intercepts all external events (such
as user interactions, XHRs, and timers) and calls the <code>$eval()</code> method on the scope object for you
at the right time. The only time you might need to call <code>$eval()</code> explicitly is when you create
your own custom widget or service.</p>

<p>The reason it is unnecessary to call <code>$eval()</code> from within your controller functions when you use
built-in angular widgets and services is because a change in the data model triggers a call to the
<code>$eval()</code> method on the scope object where the data model changed.</p>

<p>When a user inputs data, angularized widgets copy the data to the appropriate scope and then call
the <code>$eval()</code> method on the root scope to update the view. It works this way because scopes are
inherited, and a child scope <code>$eval()</code> overrides its parent's <code>$eval()</code> method. Updating the whole
page requires a call to <code>$eval()</code> on the root scope as <code>$root.$eval()</code>. Similarly, when a request
to fetch data from a server is made and the response comes back, the data is written into the model
and then <code>$eval()</code> is called to push updates through to the view and any other dependents.</p>

<p>A widget that creates scopes (such as <a href="#!/api/angular.widget.@ng:repeat"><code>ng:repeat</code></a>) is
responsible for forwarding <code>$eval()</code> calls from the parent to those child scopes. That way, calling
<code>$eval()</code> on the root scope will update the whole page. This creates a spreadsheet-like behavior
for your app; the bound views update immediately as the user enters data.</p>
