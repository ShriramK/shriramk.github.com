Time you faced it, in order to be a good programmer you will need some mathematical skills, but don't worry, you just have to be able to come up with the equations, python will actually do the calculations for you!  \r\n\r\nThis one is a bit more difficult.  \r\n\r\nThere's a famous legend about the origin of chess that goes like this. When the inventor of the game showed it to the emperor of India, the emperor was so impressed by the new game, that he said to the man, \"Name your reward!\"\r\n\r\nThe man responded, \"Oh emperor, my wishes are simple. I only wish for this. Give me one grain of rice for the first square of the chessboard, two grains for the next square, four for the next, eight for the next and so on for all 64 squares, with each square having double the number of grains as the square before.\"\r\n\r\nUse python to determine the number of grains on the last square.
